# Full Stack App with MongoDB Backend and Frontend

This is a full-stack application with MongoDB as the backend and frontend code in the client directory.

## Usage

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   - From the root directory of the project, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```
     node server/server.js
     ```

   This command will start the backend server. You should see a message indicating that the server started on port 5000.

2. **Start Frontend Development Server**:
   - After the backend server has started, navigate to the client directory from the root directory:

     ```
     cd client
     ```

   - Then, run the following command to start the frontend development server:

     ```
     npm start
     ```

   This command will launch the frontend of your application and open it in your default web browser at `localhost:3000`.

Now you can interact with the full-stack application locally. The backend server is running on port 5000, and the frontend development server is running on port 3000.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements!
